# Dashboards
HR Analytics Dashboard
This project is all about turning HR data into clear, visual insights. Using Power BI, I’ve built an interactive dashboard that helps understand workforce trends, track attrition, and explore employee demographics.

What’s Inside
Overall Employee Overview – Total employees, attrition count, attrition %, and active employees.

Attrition Analysis – See attrition broken down by department, job role, and even satisfaction rating.

Demographics – Age groups, gender distribution, and how these factors relate to attrition.

Job Satisfaction Insights – Ratings across different roles so you can spot where engagement is strong (and where it’s not).

Why This Matters
HR teams often have tons of data but no easy way to see the bigger picture. This dashboard makes it simple to answer questions like:

Which department is losing the most talent?

What age group has the highest attrition rate?

Is there a link between job satisfaction and turnover?
